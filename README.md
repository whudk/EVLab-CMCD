# üì¶ EVLab-SHPCD: A Cross-Modal Change Detection Dataset

**EVLab-SHPCD** is a cross-modal change detection benchmark proposed and led by *Prof. Xiangyun Hu*, and constructed by *Dr. Kai Deng* and other members of the **Earth Vision Laboratory (EVLab)** at Wuhan University, Hubei Province, China. The dataset is designed to promote research on detecting land use changes by combining **historical land use base maps** with **current high-resolution remote sensing imagery**.

## üóÇÔ∏è Dataset Overview

- **Training Set**: 5,225 image pairs  
- **Validation Set**: 397 image pairs  
- **Image Size**: 512 √ó 512 pixels  
- **Spatial Resolution**: 0.8 meters  

Each image pair consists of the following three components:

1. **Hlubm** (Historical Land Use Base Map)  
   - A grayscale image representing historical land use categories  
   - Pixel values range from **0 to 85**, each corresponding to a specific land use type  

2. **Crism** (Current Remote Sensing Image)  
   - A contemporary high-resolution optical remote sensing image  

3. **Target** (Change Annotation)  
   - A binary label map manually annotated  
   - Pixel value `0`: background / no change  
   - Pixel value `255`: newly developed land, including buildings, roads, and filled areas
